In this paper we have investigated and expanded upon the spherical packing approach for selecting semi-orthogonal groups of users in a wireless communications context developed in \cite{Swannack2005}. The expression given in Eq. (\ref{eq:p_e_sum_exp}) makes use of several bounds that are not expected to be tight for large group size and strict orthogonality constraints.

The work reviewed here will be used in future work focused on more robust STA-AP association in IEEE 802.11 downlink.
