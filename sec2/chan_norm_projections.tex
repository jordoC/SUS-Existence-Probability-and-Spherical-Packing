In order to formulate the problem as a sphere packing problem, channel vectors are assumed to be on the surface of a 2N-dimensional hyper-sphere. That is, the norms of each channel vector are assumed to be the same. This is evident from the definition of a hyper-sphere in $N-1$ dimensions:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sphere_def}
    \begin{aligned}
        S^{N-1} = \lbrace \underline{h_i} \in \mathbb{R}^N \ : \ \Vert \underline{h_i} \Vert = \rho \rbrace
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $S^{N-1}$ is a $N-1$ hyper-sphere, $\underline{h}_i$ is a $N+1$-length real vector that is being projected from the origin of the sphere, $\mathcal{O}$, to its surface, and $\rho$ is thre radius of the sphere.

In the case of a wireless channel experiencing deterministic path loss and Rayleigh fading, this assumption is not practically realistic. If path loss is not exactly the same for each vector, the channel norms will differ between vectors (implying they would fall on the surface of different spheres, or some other arbitrary shape). Similarly, the stochastic nature of the channel vectors due to fading will have a similar result.

However, if we assume channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the path loss can be estimated and accounted for (neglecting any estimation error in path loss, and assuming power control). Furthermore, the probability that $\Vert \underline{h_i} \Vert^2$ exists in the spherical shell defined by lower and upper radii, $\rho^-$ and $\rho^+$, respectively, is non-zero and can be easily calculated as a function of fading statistics and $\rho^-,\ \rho^+ $. An illustration of the members of this family of spheres is illustrated in Fig. $\ref{fig:concentric_sphere}$.

      % radius for outer ball

    \end{tikzpicture}
      \caption{Concentric hyper-spheres of radii $\rho^-,\rho^+$. Channel norms are restricted to this range in order to project vectors onto the surface of a hyper-sphere of constant radius. In order to pessimistically lower bound orthogonality probabilities, the larger radius of $\rho^+$ is chosen. The probability channel norms will fall into this range can be described in terms of channel fading statistics.}

The CDF of the channel norm will be denoted by $F_{\Vert\underline{hi}\Vert^2}(m,\rho)$, where $\rho$ are realizations of the random variable formed by the channel norm. Each term in the $N$-length vector, $\underline{h}_i$ is represented by two iid normal random variables: one for the real part and one for the imaginary part. When forming the L2 norm of the $N$-length vector, each multiplication forms a sum of length four where each of the arguments of the sum are a product of two random variables. Namely, the sum takes the form real$\cdot$real + real$\cdot$imaginary + imaginary$\cdot$real + imaginary$\cdot$imaginary. Thus, the CDF expression becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ch_sq_cdf_chan}
    \begin{aligned}
        F_{\Vert\underline{hi}\Vert^2}(\rho;m)& = \Gamma_n(2m,m\rho)\\
        &= Pr[\Vert\underline{h}_i\Vert^2 \leq \rho]
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_n(\cdot)$ is the incomplete normalized gamma function.

The probability that $\Vert\underline{h}_i\Vert^2$ lands in the shell between radii $\rho^+,\ \rho^-$,  is given by the subtraction of the respective CDF expressions:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:p_s}
    \begin{aligned}
        p_s = \Gamma_n(2N,N\rho^-) - \Gamma_n(2N,N\rho^+)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The issue of resolving the projection of channel vectors onto the surface of a sphere is still not entirely resolved: we have only described the probability the vectors will exist in a shell defined by upper and lower bounding radii. In order to pessimistically bound orthogonality analysis in the upcoming discussion, it is assumed that all the channel norms that exist in the shell are equal to $\rho^+$. In this way, we have a trade-off between probability of channel norms existence and accuracy of orthogonality analysis: as ${(\rho^+-\rho^-)\rightarrow 0},\ p_s\rightarrow 0$; however, as  $(\rho^+-\rho^-)$ grows, so does the inaccuracy in orthogonality analysis.
